This is my final project for Unstructured Data Analysis in Python at the University of Notre Dame. My group and I employed unsupervised learning techniques on data from from the _Jeopardy!_ question bank to improve player strategy-making and gameplay. We created 2 corpuses based on question-and-answer columns and then used TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to determine the 5 most important terms appearing in both columns to give the player clues about what they should study to prepare for the show. Examining the term frequencies demonstrated that questions have a tendency to be identification (based on 'name'), about the first of something, or are location questions. Our TF-IDF analysis revealed the importance of knowing general knowledge of current events and culture from the last 5 years and the increasing prevalence of fill in the blank questions.
